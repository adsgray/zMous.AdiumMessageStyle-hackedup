# Dev. Notes

* Putting colorsenders() in a script tag in incoming/Content.html did not work.
* Even when sourcing the script in Header.html. Not sure why...
* The selector with _not_ in it does not seem to work (always finds all the elements even when they have been marked) but the operative function returns _fast_ so maybe it doesn't matter?
